This is the DSO I use for almost everything I do. It's only 60&nbsp;MHz analog
bandwidth, but I rarely work with higher frequency signals. When I do, I
use my Hitachi V-1565 analog oscilloscope.

## Rock on!
There is an Easter egg in the oscilloscope's firmware. If you try to save a
file named `ROCK_ON` to floppy, it starts up
an [Asteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game))-type game
called Rocks.
